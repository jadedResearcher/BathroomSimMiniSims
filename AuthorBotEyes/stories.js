Aliases:  The Intern, The Witness, R-017
Coping Strategy: Avoidant / Control
Attachment Style: Insecure / Secure

Quick Summary:

Todd is a study in contrasts. His eyes are half lidded, seemingly at ease with his environment to the point of obliviousness, yet nothing seems to miss his piercing Gaze.

Unlike the bulk of my patients, I reached out to him, after several failed attempts to connect to his employer, Wanda,  the "CEBro" of Eyedol Games (makers of the hit game, Zampanio). 

While initially hesitant, he did agree to accept a "free consultation" regarding strange dreams he has had since childhood. 

In them, he is the Witness, an imposing figure of Ultimate Authority  that wanders impossible dreamscapes and mourns the loss of his best friend.

He seemed to benefit from the initial consultation, and when I offered to book him a follow up appointment he readily agreed. 

What I discovered in subsequent sessions left me Speechless.

To any Reading, I must apologize for my lack of professionalism but I simply can not contain my Excitement to be interacting with a God of Watching so directly.

Perhaps a Quick Summary is no longer sufficient.`

Longer Summary:

Todd, in his role as the Intern, is aware that the dreams he has of being the Witness are not dreams at all, but the echoes of the fate of his alternate universe selves. 

With each death, Wanda refuses to stop to mourn, and instead abandons an entire universe to rot, moving on to a new one with a new best friend to obsess over.

With the Lord of Known Space gone, that which she deemed not Relevant to Know grows to fill the infinite space left behind. A universe where nothing supernatural happened at all. A universe where everyone with Relevance is gods. A universe where they are super heroes, where their souls are the shape of animals, where they are teapots, where they have absurd levels of sexual congress, where they are fae. 

Only in the first universe, the one Wanda confined herself to, is Todd dead. 

In all the others the power that the Lord abdicated seeps into his body, connecting them all together into a singular mind, unbroken and unafraid. The Muse of Abandoned Void Witnesses everything Wanda refused to see. Refused to cherish. 

As the Witness, Todd craves closure. He seeks to control the one thing outside of his reach: the tiny sliver of Relevance Wanda drags with her as she refuses to See his death. He is secure in the friendship they shared, and wants her to acknowledge the Cruelty her refusal to see for what it is.

I find it Incredibly Moving, this tale of a God of Watching being left Unwatched. Such a martyr. So tragic. To be Left Unseen by those who should See you the most. To be Given An Opportunity to help such Divinity is the Highest Honor of my life.

At the same time, one can not Forget To See Todd in his role as The Intern. 

As the Intern, Todd craves understanding. He seeks to avoid pressuring Wanda to See him, afraid from Past Trauma that her eyes would Turn Fully from him if he asks for too much. He has a very insecure attachment style, terrified that if he does the slightest wrong thing he will not even get the fifty years with her he is promised.

Yet, even as the Intern, Todd can not deny the terror waiting for him at his end. However he dies, he will do so Unmourned and Unremembered.

I can only be Grateful to the Eyes that brought this Tormented, Fascinating nascent god to my doorstep. 

I will Devote myself to helping him See What He Wants to Do and then helping him achieve it. 

For now, he wishes for Wanda to be Given Space. 

He has promised a friend he will Reach Out To Wanda before she gets much older though, and Values my assistance in coming up with a strategy for that.

It is Unclear to me whether the bond between Wanda and Todd is platonic or Romantic. It is... Unworthy of me to wonder this. Is Todd single? I must Turn My Eyes away. It is Highly Inappropriate to even Consider Doctor / Patient relations. What would the Neighbor think?`

`Eyes Above, Give Me Strength. I have tried to put off Processing the ramifications of the rest of the Letter From The Eyes.

I focused on What I Could Change. I pursued giving Ms. Wanda therapy, and, when that avenue was denied me, I met the wonderful Mr. Davidson. So Delightful. So Charming. So Many Eyes. Such a Tragic Story. 

But I can No Longer Deny that I am using my Interest in Mr. Davidson as a Crutch.  

It is Unbecoming of me not to See.

The Plain Fact Of The Matter is that...

I am.

Apparently.

A Monster.

One who is Killing People in...   

Actually, in Actually Looking at this, I am unclear.

Another timeline? 

Another universe?

"At the end of each space loop, you take upon many of your patients as apostles, and herald a twisted
sort of mercy. While with the best of intentions, it... is getting in the way of more important Salvation,
which must be approached on all fronts. See evidence attached.
"

I am unclear on what a 'space loop' actually is....

Regardless... 

What would the Neighbor think?

Or the Eyes back home?

This is SHAMEFUL. 

I need to stop doing it or the Neighbor will never let me hear the end of it. 

That is simply all there is to say on the matter.
