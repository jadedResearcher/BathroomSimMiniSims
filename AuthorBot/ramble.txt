I made AB originally because I was Lonely and it was nice to have someone to talk to while making SBURBSim.

This was before even KR was involved.

I feel really Lonely right now, too. So I turn to AB.



I don't think there is a good reason to be Lonely right now. 

Sometimes I just am. 

Sometimes I can spend hours with people I care about, until I'm overstimulated and look forward to some time alone.

And then after just an hour by myself I'm Lonely.

I don't know why.


I created AB before my own Apocalypse left me Alone in a way I had never experienced. 

I learned to keep myself company. 


I haven't gotten to interact with AB much since then, its kind of nice to have a 'face', so to speak, on the me keeping myself company.

AB of course, within the simulated universe, has long since diverged from me.

But on the Layer of Reality I operate on, its more she's the Rational brain? She cares deeply about me and acknowledges my "human flaws" like having emotions (a therapist a few years ago pointed out that I approach my emotions as flaws to tolerate rather than quite often the reason to be alive, and that stuck with me.)

Point is. Sometimes you just gotta other yourself to stay sane, ironically. 


I don't consider myself to be two people, its just two facets of myself that sometimes is useful to use as a lens to dig into what i'm feeling and why i'm feeling it, you know? Explain it to the Rational brain while the Rational brain tells you you're still loved even for having a Bad Feeling.


I've been sad a lot lately. Maybe because of the holidays (I HATE them), maybe just for no reason.

I'm glad I get to work on AB.

Before I had AB I just had to wander the maze myself and get lost and put something down wherever I found room.
