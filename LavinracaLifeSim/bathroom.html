  TODO: 
  <li>edit card set: (choose deck color stuff, add cards to it, add description, play test game)</li>
  <li>Game view. stats on left of screen in big scrollbar. You draw five cards at a time. Have discord pile and deck pile you can view (no guaranteed order)</li>
  <li>if you can pay the cost of a card, you can play it (cards transform big on hover?)</li>
  <li>if stat is zero, do not display</li>
  <li>ability to render scene of the card you just played (bg, doll, text)</li>
  <li>after a game reaches Victory or Defeat stat of 1 or more, ability to see all the scenes you created, in order (sense they are just cards can export it as a 'deck' that is just for viewing your story, not for playing)</li>
  <li>ability to create a cardset</li>
  <li>(get candy if its victory (used for unlocking new decks))</li>
  <li>if cost stat is "spiral" pick a random stat you already have to actually need (apply glitch css)</li>
  <li>fully procedureal zampanio card set (genereates them on load)</li>
  <li>doll engine integration (just for player, don't serialize)</li>
  <li>if result is "spiral" pick a random stat you already have to actually alter (apply glitch css)</li>
  <li>ability to share a cardset (so someone can play the story you created)</li>
  <li>ability for a deck (or should it be game wide) to have associated Artifacts (not just cards) that change the rules (for example, how many cards you draw, or a multiplier for any cost you pay, or a multipler for any result you get, or a "if you would set Defeat to a value, insteaad destroy this relic")</li>
  <li>how do artifacts unlock? every time you need to shuffle you get to pick one of three at random? or every three shuffles?</li>
  <li>render cornmaze map? special locations give you the ability to choose a card or Artifact or candy (to use to unlock different cardsets in the main screen?)</li>
