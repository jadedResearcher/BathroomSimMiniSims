  June TODO: 

  <li>  * card set builder (title, description, possibleCards, startingDeck)</li>
  <li>* winning gets you candy (put in local storage), plus record of what card you won with (can be harder victory conditions)</li>
  <li>* shop view (lets you buy cards for candy, resets after a victory, also lets you remove cards for a lot of money that exponentially grows till a victory)</li>
  <li>* depending on what victory cards are in your localStorage, shop has different Artifacts for sale that chang rules and also can buy new cardsets to get new story bits</li>
  <li>* ability to pray to harvest (only during what would previously be lunch breaks and her 15s (she considers the card game play, and only works occasionaly now)</li>


  TODO: 
  <li>edit card set: (choose deck color stuff, add cards to it, add description, play test game)</li>
  <li>The Harvest parses this as PLAY (its the camellia in her, cardgames are her life) so for an hour at noon and midnight and two random 15 minute breaks, she panics and takes prayers. she got so into the card game she forgot to work.</li>
  <li>prayers given to the harvest are answered via new card decks (created by me)</li>
  <li>rework ui to have desktop and mobile modes (rather than trying to work for both)</li>
  <li>ability to render scene of the card you just played (bg, doll, text)</li>
  <li>JR NOTE: no, no doll to be you, lets cards be more than just bgs (like pic of wibby) ~~don't forget to add a little clown doll to be 'you'~~</li>
  <li>after a game reaches Victory or Defeat stat of 1 or more, ability to see all the scenes you created, in order (sense they are just cards can export it as a 'deck' that is just for viewing your story, not for playing)</li>
  <li>ability to create a cardset</li>
  <li>(get candy if its victory (used for unlocking new decks))</li>
  <li>if cost stat is "spiral" pick a random stat you already have to actually need (apply glitch css)</li>
  <li>fully procedureal zampanio card set (genereates them on load)</li>
  <li>if result is "spiral" pick a random stat you already have to actually alter (apply glitch css)</li>
  <li>ability to share a cardset (so someone can play the story you created)</li>
  <li>ability for a deck (or should it be game wide) to have associated Artifacts (not just cards) that change the rules (for example, how many cards you draw, or a multiplier for any cost you pay, or a multipler for any result you get, or a "if you would set Defeat to a value, insteaad destroy this relic")</li>
  <li>how do artifacts unlock? every time you need to shuffle you get to pick one of three at random? or every three shuffles?</li>
  <li>render cornmaze map? special locations give you the ability to choose a card or Artifact or candy (to use to unlock different cardsets in the main screen?)</li>
