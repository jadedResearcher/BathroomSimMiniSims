Hallow and Eve are kittens I've adopted. 

Hallow has no eyes. Eve has trouble breathing.

Hallow is all black, Eve is black and orange and white.

Hallow, the shelter claims, was born on Halloween. 

Eve was his best friend at the shelter and helped him get around. 

Hallow's Eve.

If we get a third kitten, we'll name them a pun on "All".

All Hallow's Eve.
