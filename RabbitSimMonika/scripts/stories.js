/*

people are watching a "lets play" of zampanio. 

every ten seconds theres a flash of an ai melted "BE KIND: REWIND"

they're discussing the 'rumors' about what happens to people who play zampanio. joking that its okay, they're only WATCHING someone play it.

actually did you here that they found the streamers comatose body in an alleyway somewhere?

in the console, truth is crooning to you. come. join.

dig a little deeper. what could it hurt?

if you rewind, the chat rewinds as well. they notice. you've caught them in a loop. if the video itself loops, too.

*/



/*
    multiple ways we could do this. the easiest is "when your time code hits, add yourself with a lil sound";

    but one thing that could be interesting is 'if the video is rewound, so too is time'. (could play with that)

//yes yes, i'm bad for using global variables, so sue me, i'm going fast
