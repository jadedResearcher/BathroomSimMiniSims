    <h1>IMPORTANT: VERY SIMPLE GRAPHICS, ALL CSS/HTML/ascii</h1>
    <h1>TODO: core loop</h1>
    <ul>

      <li>on friday and midnight: * force refresh page
      * disable saving
      * load special save file with no truth, 0 truth per second, a single fact (Zampanio Needs You To Live A Long Life) and a single room where you type into a text box that you need to take a break, zampanio will still be here later, the end is never the end so you are not nearly done, its a marathon, not a race      <li>witherby's confessional next (if a fact mentions a blorbo they come confess to him, otherwise a random goncharov char does procedural confessions) (after one confession is forgiven, you win) (closer doens't confess, she just leaves (unwinnable))</li>
    </li>
    <li>confessional</li>
      <li>after store and confessional unlocks, new room for RESETTING THE LOOP (all your save data besides obsessionCurrentValue and dates gets erased) (refactor truth per second in maze rewards to be multiplied by factor of obsessionCurrentValue, not scaling on its own)</li>
      <li>devona room that lets you read fact lore (part of two doors lie and truth?)</li> 
      <li>clear up hacked initial save day, play with scaling</li> 
       <li></li>
      <li>mini games :) :) :) (whatever takes my fancy, use guide and friend sprites)</li>
      <li>ability to delete save</li>
      <li>opening quiz that claims its going to make a game entirely personalized for you (its lying) (throw it out)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>
      NEXT TODO:</h1>

      <ul>
        <li> * after beating one maze, unlock eye killer clicking mini game (damage you do is based on truth multiplier)
          (speed and hp and number of cultsists is based on all time truth plus theme attack/defense)
        </li>
        <li>* implement fact system, first fact that will exist is "The Quatro Blade can creates wounds that can not be
          percieved." (killing and obfuscation themed)
        </li>
        <li>* after beating two mazes unlock above fact
        </li>
        <li>* each room view has, in the upper left, a drop down that lets you assign a single fact to it (adds
          temporary themes to the room, and alteres it in other ways) (need to have an "init" that all minigames call OR
          have maze view take care of that before letting the mini game render (basically rerender mini game but now
          with fact))
        </li>
        <li>* if a fact with the words "Quatro Blade" are given to the eye killer mini game, each click does its
          per-click damage over time to EVERYTHING on screen (much easier)
        </li>
        <li>* tab for showing what FACTS you have
        </li>
        <li>* add damage and defense multiplier for each theme (for example guiding is highly defensive), useful to
          modify the eye killer mini game in procedural ways
        </li>
        <li>* another fact: "the eye killer has the quatro blade" theme is killing and time
        </li>
        <li>parker mini game, every 13 seconds your gun goes off. if you don't have it over a target, it'll pick one at random. don't kill hatsune miku</li>

        <li>* finally do the shop tab where the closer sells exponentially more expensive facts (but what facts they are
          are random per maze)
      </ul>

        <li>each time you beat the mini game, unlocks one new room from it till fully unlocked</li>
        <li>can ALWAYS play the mini game, but for each unlock level can choose to move on N,S or E (i.e. you beat it
          once you can go north, if you beat it twice can go north or south ) (obviously only if it HAS those directions
          as non dead ends)</li>
        <li>Button to ASSIGN A FACT from your inventory to this room, which will alter it based on themes or title
          (removes it from inventory and instead stores it in this room) </li>
        <li>button to take a fact currently assigned to the room and put in your inventory instead</li>
        <li>has list of 0-3 rooms it adds to the unlocked pool on unlock (and are its exits) (random which is mapped to

        <li>some rooms only care about SPECIFIC facts being assigned to them (like closer being wiggler eater)</li>
        <li>some rooms respond to a handful of themes in new ways (like lonely plus religion)</li>
        <li>others have tiny little changes that can happen based on ANY theme you give it (tyfings combat alters what
          enemies based on themes) (defeating a specific enemy for the first time might drop a new fact)</li>
      </ul>

      </li>
    </ul>

    <li>sucker for love style mousing over text without leaving it to chant (doc slaughter?)</li>

    <ul>
      <li>neville stock room (fact (or other item???) milk from rods fridge?  reselling with price variation based on seed of all time truth on room entry)(buy low sell high) 
      </li><li>  fair games like ring toss (truth rimgs are  the ring) (truth hates this)</li>
      <li>MOST room should be about broader zampanio in jokes and lore  (don't just focus on teh ones from my branch)</li>
      <li>a single bathroom  and single bedroom  (in the ENTIRE game)(reference to 12 million dollar hotel room)(if you reset without seeing it, oh well) (no, i wont be that mean, if you never beat it they will keep spawning)</li>
      <li>ogs rooms (closers store, flower chicks points shop, tyfings combat,

      <li>yongki mini game: collect the snails (if you accidentally click more than once on a snail before it finishes
        its animation it explodes into blood), mini game ends</li>
      <li>captain mini game: keep your face from changing and making you weird (use grid based glitch animation from
        jackelope)</li>

        <li>sam is blinding web of blood</li>

    <h1>TODO: branch loop</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>obsession is a dangerous thing, the minotaur would like  you to leave now</li>
      <li>another simple room that is just two doors, neville and devona and one of them is randomly telling the truth

      <li>some rooms only enter pool if you have enough all time truth</li>
      <li>bee breeding room, honey stored along side truth, used for the slot machine to get rare facts</li>
      <li>probably could keep a rand JUST inside the maze for room generation that doesn't get influenced by things like
        mini games</li>
      <li>emphasize how twig and sam are doing post lavinraca/lavinraca</li>
      <li>collectable crystals like that vrchat game</li>

      <li>closers room spawns with fact "Babies are Made of Fruit" that you can take from the room, transforming the
        WigglerEater into the closer and opening the shop up for business (and unlocks it)</li>
      <li>each area of the map has a specific challenge you must beat to get further. first area is closer, she simply

      <li>if you are tabbed away for long enough (animation frame can tell, can anything else) truth gets *huffy*, how
        dare you stop paying attention to it</li>
      <li>if you've been playing a while, Truth in the save tab starts asking you if you like it. starts warming up to
        you. especially if you've played the amount of time science says it takes to make friends or develop a habbit
      </li>
      <li>if its been a while since it loaded, Truth starts pestering you to take breaks because its a marathon not a
        sprint</li>
      <li>special things that happen based on total play time this session or ever (in save tab?)</li>
      <li>each time you visit the map the rooms you've unlocked appear connected in a random order</li>
      <li>if you've already beaten a room you can either move to any of its exits OR redo its challenge in infinite mode
        (for Truth)</li>
      <li>each room has up to three rooms it can unlock next (if has three need to beat three times)</li>
      <li>in map, closer has a shop that lets you trade Truth for Facts (stored in inventory, which unlocks) (the unique
        themes you have in your facts unlock conversations with the Closer)</li>
      <li>inventory is tab that lets you view all facts as well as your current truth and obsession modifier</li>
      <li>in map, tyrfing has a "infinite glorious combat" mode (candbox 2 style combat, constantly moving right, no
        input?, you only fight clone babies) you need to survive for 85 seconds to be allowed move on (facts spawn magic
        spells you can cast based on themes)</li>
      <li>keep adding more possible rooms</li>
      <li>playtest volunteers: zead</li>
