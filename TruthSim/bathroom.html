  <h1>IMPORTANT: VERY SIMPLE GRAPHICS, ALL CSS/HTML/ascii</h1>
  <h1>TODO: core loop</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>save data to local storage every minute (notify?)</li>
    <li>at 13 you get option to forget 13 Truths</li>
    <li>at 113 you get a tab that lets you save</li>
    <li>at 217 you unlock the rabbit hole (lets you put in passwords in exchange for Facts)</li>
    <li>Facts have a lore snippet, a Truth Multiplier and an Obsession Multiplier and an array of themes (that parts of
      the maze can use however they want, for example spawning buttons like candybox2 spells)</li>
    <li>at 273 you get a 'map' (prototype procedural grid based map like issac has?)</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>TODO: objects</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>FACT
      <ul>
        <li>TITLE</li>
        <li>lore_snippet</li>
        <li>truth_multiplier (can be 1)</li>
        <li>theme_key_array</li>
        <li>is_viral (if you give it to a room will it spread)</li>
      </ul>
      <li>ROOM</li>
      <ul>
        <li>knows how to render itself (change TINT based on assigned fact themes) and runs a lil mini game</li>
        <li>knows unlock level (number between 0 and number of child rooms)</li>
        <li>list of facts currently assigned to room</li>
        <li>each time you beat the mini game, unlocks one new room from it till fully unlocked</li>
        <li>can ALWAYS play the mini game, but for each unlock level can choose to move on N,S or E (i.e. you beat it once you can go north, if you beat it twice can go north or south ) (obviously only if it HAS those directions as non dead ends)</li>
        <li>Button to ASSIGN A FACT from your inventory to this room, which will alter it based on themes or title  (removes it from inventory and instead stores it in this room) </li>
        <li>button to take a fact currently assigned to the room and put in your inventory instead</li>
        <li>has list of 0-3 rooms it adds to the unlocked pool on unlock (and are its exits) (random which is mapped to which exit tho)</li>
        <li>some rooms only care about SPECIFIC facts being assigned to them (like closer being wiggler eater)</li>
        <li>some rooms respond to a handful of themes in new ways (like lonely plus religion)</li>
        <li>others have tiny little changes that can happen based on ANY theme you give it (tyfings combat alters what enemies based on themes) (defeating a specific enemy for the first time might drop a new fact)</li>
      </ul>

    </li>
  </ul>

  <h1>TODO: branch loop</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>hide this somewhere https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gY8mFR74jaoj6KgbK9R2IdajabKK_hjE/view?usp=sharing ( a fact?) </li>
    <li>occasionally play weird sounds (every time you reach a new milestone of number of trailing zeroes?)</li>
    <li>closers room spawns with fact "Babies are Made of Fruit" that you can take from the room, transforming the WigglerEater into the closer and opening the shop up for business (and unlocks it)</li>
    <li>each area of the map has a specific challenge you must beat to get further. first area is closer, she simply
      wants Commerce</li>
      <li>if you are tabbed away for long enough (animation frame can tell, can anything else) truth gets *huffy*, how dare you stop paying attention to it</li>
      <li>if you've been playing a while, Truth in the save tab starts asking you if you like it. starts warming up to you.</li>
      <li>if its been a while since it loaded, Truth starts pestering you to take breaks because its a marathon not a sprint</li>
      <li>special things that happen based on total play time this session or ever (in save tab?)</li>
    <li>each time you visit the map the rooms you've unlocked appear connected in a random order</li>
    <li>if you've already beaten a room you can either move to any of its exits OR redo its challenge in infinite mode
      (for Truth)</li>
    <li>each room has up to three rooms it can unlock next (if has three need to beat three times)</li>
    <li>in map, closer has a shop that lets you trade Truth for Facts (stored in inventory, which unlocks) (the unique
      themes you have in your facts unlock conversations with the Closer)</li>
    <li>inventory is tab that lets you view all facts as well as your current truth and obsession modifier</li>
    <li>in map, tyrfing has a "infinite glorious combat" mode (candbox 2 style combat, constantly moving right, no
      input?, you only fight clone babies) you need to survive for 85 seconds to be allowed move on (facts spawn magic
      spells you can cast based on themes)</li>
    <li>keep adding more possible rooms</li>
