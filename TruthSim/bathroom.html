    <h1>IMPORTANT: VERY SIMPLE GRAPHICS, ALL CSS/HTML/ascii</h1>
    <h1>TODO: core loop</h1>
    <ul>

      <li>on friday and midnight: * force refresh page
      * disable saving
      * load special save file with no truth, 0 truth per second, a single fact (Zampanio Needs You To Live A Long Life) and a single room where you type into a text box that you need to take a break, zampanio will still be here later, the end is never the end so you are not nearly done, its a marathon, not a race      <li>witherby's confessional next (if a fact mentions a blorbo they come confess to him, otherwise a random goncharov char does procedural confessions) (after one confession is forgiven, you win) (closer doens't confess, she just leaves (unwinnable))</li>
    </li>
    <li>confessional</li>
      <li>after store and confessional unlocks, new room for RESETTING THE LOOP (all your save data besides obsessionCurrentValue and dates gets erased) (refactor truth per second in maze rewards to be multiplied by factor of obsessionCurrentValue, not scaling on its own)</li>
      <li>devona room that lets you read fact lore </li> 
       <li>cfo gamer store (the points you get for spending money in closers store is called "trust" since the watched eyes said so</li>
      <li>mini games :) :) :) (whatever takes my fancy, use guide and friend sprites)</li>
      <li>ability to delete save</li>
      <li>opening quiz that claims its going to make a game entirely personalized for you (its lying) (throw it out)
      </li>
    </ul>
    

      </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Room ideas (most as small as wario ware i think) </h1>
    <li>camellia room, where piper_motif.mp3 plays and she's just contemplatative about the whole harvest thing and her role in cults, you can move on after song ends</li>
    <li>alt room that is a copy of the maze but you can't earn anything and the rooms you unlock are procedural and weirdly meaty</li>
      <li>smug JR attic room that transform the whole page to black and white inverted (besides themself)</li>
    <li>room with FRIEND in it who gives you a quest and/or lets you RESET THE LOOP (usually having specific facts or more/less than a specific truth
      value)</li>
      <li>slot machine: input truth, get rare facts, truth or rooms. run by hoon. you get the wrong value, she beats the shit out of you and you lose all your truth</li>
      <li>leehunter mini game: one always lies, one always tells the truth. leehunter randomize who the liar is and
        you pay them Truths to get hints on which door to choose. door is worth 10x how much a hint costs</li>
    <li>sucker for love style mousing over text without leaving it to chant (doc slaughter?)</li>
    <li>k's room: laundromat that lets you launder your  facts (each time you do it costs 10 more facts to be sacrificed to get one out (how we keep it from being cluttery)) (wipe the old clean and replace it with a procedural one k writes about himself (if you give him a complimentary fact in the room he'll smugly let you try too (write in facts and choose theme from drop down))) (since they are all stored in save data rather than keys), just so many lies</li>

    <li>neville and devona room for truth and lies, devonas reward is getting to read the lore associated with your fact, nevilles reward is getting to do stock stuff</li>
    <li>lil amongus tasks like cleaning laundry</li>
    <li>pong while truth insults you</li>
    <li>bee puns, bee holder (view blorbo bios?), spelling bee</li>
    <li>visual and audio memory puzzle (like simon says physical game)</li>
    <li>tom peyote dress up game (spot the difference but its hilariously easy)</li>
    <li>base room is wario ware style micro games staring blorbos that shift based on what facts you give them</li>
    <ul>
      <li>neville stock room (fact (or other item???) milk from rods fridge?  reselling with price variation based on seed of all time truth on room entry)(buy low sell high) 
      </li><li>  fair games like ring toss (truth rimgs are  the ring) (truth hates this)</li>
      <li>MOST room should be about broader zampanio in jokes and lore  (don't just focus on teh ones from my branch)</li>
      <li>a single bathroom  and single bedroom  (in the ENTIRE game)(reference to 12 million dollar hotel room)(if you reset without seeing it, oh well) (no, i wont be that mean, if you never beat it they will keep spawning)</li>

        its animation it explodes into blood), mini game ends</li>
      <li>captain mini game: keep your face from changing and making you weird (use grid based glitch animation from
        jackelope)</li>

        <li>sam is blinding web of blood</li>

<li>twig is corrupted hound of breath</li>
      <li>k mini game, he just info dumps to you about himself and pays you for it (exposition booth)</li>

    </ul>

    <h1>TODO: branch loop</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>obsession is a dangerous thing, the minotaur would like  you to leave now</li>
      <li>room that looks like Norths loading screen with rotating tips but it never ends (have to find the secret way to close the menu, truth is proud of you)</li>
      <li>another simple room that is just two doors, neville and devona and one of them is randomly telling the truth
        and one of them is randomly lying , about which door is right, can bribe them with Truth to get hints, get 100
        truth if you're right</li>
      <li>facts, please (and fact store)</li>
      <li>rare keys that will let you unlock a room for free without beating its neighbor</li>
      <li>some room types only unlock based on your truth multiplier
      </li>
      <li>rare room with FRIEND in who gives you quests</li>
      <li> tab that lets you store up to three mazes in your SAVE DATA so you can re-run them (if you find a good one)
      </li>
      <li>if all rooms are unlocked, option to reset maze and get truth multiplier +1</li>
      <li>some rooms only enter pool if you have enough all time truth</li>
      <li>bee breeding room, honey stored along side truth, used for the slot machine to get rare facts</li>
      <li>probably could keep a rand JUST inside the maze for room generation that doesn't get influenced by things like
        mini games</li>
      <li>emphasize how twig and sam are doing post lavinraca/lavinraca</li>
      <li>collectable crystals like that vrchat game</li>
      <li>room that lets you reset your maze but keep everything you've found</li>
      <li>hide this somewhere https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gY8mFR74jaoj6KgbK9R2IdajabKK_hjE/view?usp=sharing ( a
        fact?) </li>
      <li>occasionally play weird sounds (every time you reach a new milestone of number of trailing zeroes?)</li>
      <li>closers room spawns with fact "Babies are Made of Fruit" that you can take from the room, transforming the
        WigglerEater into the closer and opening the shop up for business (and unlocks it)</li>
      <li>each area of the map has a specific challenge you must beat to get further. first area is closer, she simply
        wants Commerce</li>
      <li>if you are tabbed away for long enough (animation frame can tell, can anything else) truth gets *huffy*, how
        dare you stop paying attention to it</li>
      <li>if you've been playing a while, Truth in the save tab starts asking you if you like it. starts warming up to
        you. especially if you've played the amount of time science says it takes to make friends or develop a habbit
      </li>
      <li>if its been a while since it loaded, Truth starts pestering you to take breaks because its a marathon not a
        sprint</li>
      <li>special things that happen based on total play time this session or ever (in save tab?)</li>
      <li>each time you visit the map the rooms you've unlocked appear connected in a random order</li>
      <li>if you've already beaten a room you can either move to any of its exits OR redo its challenge in infinite mode
        (for Truth)</li>
      <li>each room has up to three rooms it can unlock next (if has three need to beat three times)</li>
      <li>in map, closer has a shop that lets you trade Truth for Facts (stored in inventory, which unlocks) (the unique
        themes you have in your facts unlock conversations with the Closer)</li>
      <li>inventory is tab that lets you view all facts as well as your current truth and obsession modifier</li>
      <li>in map, tyrfing has a "infinite glorious combat" mode (candbox 2 style combat, constantly moving right, no
        input?, you only fight clone babies) you need to survive for 85 seconds to be allowed move on (facts spawn magic
        spells you can cast based on themes)</li>
      <li>keep adding more possible rooms</li>
      <li>playtest volunteers: zead</li>
