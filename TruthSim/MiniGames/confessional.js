IC: k is unexpectedly beloved for a character jr would not touch the moment they were made
it's really funny
sometimes we're the ones who are wrong

JR:

i hated him on sight
but 
its been interesting twisting myself to understand him
would not let him within five feet of devona
of course
but
k is actually fairly easy to get along with if you never challenge his reality
kinda cathartic way to proccess stuff about my mom

and honestly
my Wretched Pomeranian
the ppl who get along best with k are the ones with strong personalities ive found?
lee hunter are both eager to follow ria and also stubborn and fighty and  give k plenty of attention/fights without taking anything personally
and ria has her weak points but "blindly accepting others reality" isnt one of them 


instead whatever unhinged thing k says puts her on a research spiral
and even if she ends up disproving him
hes so happy he got all that attention he doesn't care/claims he always believed that and ria was great for working so hard to prove him right
while devona just dissolves into stress sweat around k
and neville's obliviousness upsets k so much
and wibbys strong Attachment skill just upsets them both
k needs so much attention wibby gets drained
and k can FEEL how instantly checked out witherby is
so only gets more annoying about it to try to get more attention

camille loves k
lil gremlin man who is yearning to get stronger
she can train him

if k let himself notice that shes patronizing to him they would have problems but he considers her a minion, like yongki

he has tricked her into training him  you see

see thats whats great
k is the lil bastard gremlin in all of us
the selfish 'what about me' core
and it was cathartic learning to actually understand that part of myself?
like
k is the most "realistically" evil char we have
the most "irredeemable"
but , without him changing his core personality or suppressing his needs
he found a path towards friendship and happiness and harming others less
instead of curling in a ball of self hatred and pain till witherby or devona  or neville gave him what he wanted
he found people who weren't just happy to give it to him, but they needed it too?
Camille LOVES one on one training someone smaller and weaker and seeing them grow
ria loves taking care of others
lee hunter love petty little squabbling 
all of them had hurt themselves in the past trying to satisfy these desires on the wrong people
its not just k who had to find his tribe, you know?
its not a story about a selfish bastard learning to just Stop Having Needs, you know?

or Mean People Excluding Someone learning to stop having boundaries
devona will never be friends with k and thats okay
k will never stop being a gremlin who lashes out if he feels in danger
and thats okay, given he finds safe directions for it
and god are leehunter ALWAYS thrilled to listen to k gripe about, say, witherby and say catty shit about how right k is 
and so witherby doesn't get fucking murdered in his sleep
because before to k, he felt so SMALL
like the tiniest threat to his status would kill him?
mosquito souled bastard that he is
but being reminded that there are ppl out there that think he is Big and also hate who he hates
is nice
reaffirming

doesn't make him feel backed into a corner at the slightest insults
