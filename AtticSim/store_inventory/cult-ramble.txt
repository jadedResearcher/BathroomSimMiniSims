okay in SOME definitions of the term, i keep starting cults

HOWEVER
the dangerous type i actively try to educate folk against
"high control group" i think is another term?

```Cults are dangerous because they typically rely on deceptive and authoritarian practices to make members dependent on and obedient to the group. Cults often cut members off from other forms of social and financial support and pose both physical and psychological risks to members of the group```


"i am immune to cults because i am ornery" is literally how qanon caught ppl
gotta know how to recognize the actual tactics


what fascinates me is that even well meaning groups can easily fall into the patterns of becoming a cult
rarely is it something explicitly planned from day one?
none of us are immune to propaganda and insular thinking
so i consider "not becoming a high control group/cult" an active thing to work towards 
strategies im currently using:

* praising zampanio fans that take breaks or even leave the fandom

* actively discourage money being given to me and reminding others to be careful with their money

* encourage zampanio fans to continue pursuing other hobbies and talking to existing friends about non zampanio topics

* literally no control on my part or anyone's part, zampanio by definition is whatever bears that label. no gatekeeping, no following an authority


and i am pursuing these anti cult tactics through the very same mechanisms that make cults fun to play pretend in, rather than through things that spoil the fun:

* ominous vibes

* two cakes (all creation is important rather than only the highest quality)

* increasing tiers of ingroups one can belong to (unmarked, titled, sparked, flamed, inferno, marked, butlers, wastes)  with most of the highest tiers being given to those who rest, disengage or otherwise show marathon rather than sprint behavior

* repeated phrases triggered frequently (obsession is a dangerous thing  the truth is layered, hydration, marathon not a sprint, zampanio needs you to live a long life, etc)

* explicit guidance on how to best engage with zampanio (grow stronger: learn new skills, get enough rest,  meet your bodily and social needs, do not isolate yourself or obsess) that is both good advice and ominous in context (zampanio has infected your brain and so the stronger you are the stronger it is, unlike cults that prefer individuals weak)

lol  its an important topic to me  if my morning ramble indicates anything

theres an anti cult charity i donate too

okay so  per my whole "discourage money from going anywhere because of words i say" thing i won't name it but
its goal is to spread education on psychological manipulation as well as supporting those who realize they want out of high control groups
and to support the family members/friends/etc of people not yet ready to face the fact that they have been manipulated

so if someone is scared and desperate because, say, their brother joined a cult, they can reach out to the organization and get support and education 
theres definitely things you can do to make the cults job way easier
like , lashing out at the victim, blaming them  trying to "make them see" the cult is dangerous?

it helps the cults narrative that the victim is isolated, that the outside world "doesn't understand" the way the cult does

so the focus is usually on trying to remain patient and supportive but to remind the victim how extreme their beliefs are becoming
and then if someone realizes they've been in a cult, they can help them leave

leaving is HARD, because cults are like hunting traps in that all the sharp parts are pointed such that while entering you dont even notice but if you try backing up they dig in

anything from "you already pissed off your previous support network with all your cult bullshit so now if you leave the cult you will be utterly ALONE" 

to 

"you were so far gone you gave the cult access to your bank account and transferred the deed to your car to them so if you leave you are RUINED"

and its so fuckin subtle how they get you to do dumb shit like give them your finances

they get you feeling good and safe,  they help you with small things, get you used to their presence 24/7, then they just so happen to notice you annoyed at navigating bills, or baffled at your 401(k) options or whatever 

and casually mention, no pressure, that they actually have this group financial counselor thing, can totally help you get your life on track

and everyone pools their money so they can benefit from getting to do stock bullshit like rich ppl do

so just sign here and you dont have to worry again

then once you do that there's increasing pressure to let them in just a bit more, give them just a bit more

and any concerns you might have if they push a bit too hard  well,  its just a sign youre UNGRATEFUL

they were just trying to help

but if you dont WANT their help  they get it, you can have your space

and then you get ghosted for days, maybe a week, entirely no contact after the constant love bombing

so when they come back youre desperate to do the thing they wanted

grateful

and significantly less likely to express doubt a second time
and

IMPORTANTLY

if youre NOT desperate, not grateful?

then they cut you off completely and talk shit about you to members so you are an example of how serious they are that only ",good" people get to stay

and the thing is, the POINT is

none of the individual members have to be EVIL to do this, or even aware
its natural human tendency to get defensive and annoyed if someone acts like its STUPID to do the thing you already did and were recommending them to do
and defensive, annoyed ppl avoid the person they are mad at for awhile
and talk shit about ppl they dont make up with 

and if you add an actual asshole cult leader into the mix, subtly encouraging and demonstrating ways to express that frustration
it solidifies quickly
cults man
