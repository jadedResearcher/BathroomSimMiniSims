I finally...

Felt like ria today. 

I was stressed and panicking and trying to F1X TH1NGs.

and in the back of my mind i realized that i kind of

thought
hoped
maybe
that


that if i made a mistake while freaking out
if i broke everything forever

id finally be free

that it would be at tragic accident but couldn't be helped
the rot takes all in the end you know

































i don't know what to do with this revelation. 

i don't know how to turn off the stressed hyper-responsible response

i don't know how to free myself from my chains

i tried. 

god knows i tried. 

but i don't see a path out without a conflagration. 


























so that probably means i should brush my teeth and get some sleep and eat something healthy in the morning. 

its what Camille would want for ria.

so.




i'll do my best.
