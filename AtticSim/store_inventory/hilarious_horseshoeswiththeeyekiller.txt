incredible horseshoes IC let me know

Piper is the source for the eye killer, from 5darps. The Catalyst i think was watching that?

Anyways, IC plays Piper..

And we found out that basically every zampanio beat she has has come true in the rp

~~~~

okay so: i am so right
eye killer was hallucinating the cult chasing her all along (and so was piper), reality overlapping is literally how she's always worked in zampanio (twig/sam quatro blade, etc)

she also has hunt base dpowers

(inspired by us realizing the Innocent is the most normal piper, cuz she's not the protag in a yugioh rp)

the innocent/mundane eye killer gets a job at hoons gas station in arm3
hoon teaches her to load a gun and defend herself

she's kinda trigger happy at the idea of shooting ppl who try to rob her at gunpoint
hoon approves

it doesn't really happen often though, hoon keeps the neighborhood mostly safe

hoon also teaches her how to exploit credit cards and bulk grocrery stores for cashback

wibby and piper were both homeless while young and hoon just parses as mentor figure to them
no one else thinks hoon is so cool and safe and good, just them

hoon does not like cops

piper always always always wants found family
and a lens to view the world
and hoon is like "yup, world's dangerous, here's how you stay safe, also i will protect you but i want you to be able to protect yourself if it comes to it"

okay my notes are done and im off the call with IC

BASICALLY

it turns out what the eye killer did to sam/twig COULD be exactly what happened to her

the cult she was running from was one that could merge timelines to get just the parts of each they wanted
and theres evidence that piper wanted to leave the cult and instinctively moved to a timeline where SHE could

but the version of her in that timeline hadn't, so paradox timeclone (camellia, which was pipers original name before she changed everything about herself to hide)


so the cult was never chasing her because they didn't even know she existed (which was her wish in the first place, to be somewhere she could leave the cult without being hunted down)


so just like in zampanio,the cult chasing piper was entirely imaginary....until she takes action and makes it real (piper might kill a cult member in her rp and kick the hornests nest hile the eye killer caused her victims to band together in the loops to defend against her, eventually sanding smooth to being a cult)


NOT only that, but piper has an artifact in the rp which lets her track anyone down she wants


we were so right that she was hunt and time
