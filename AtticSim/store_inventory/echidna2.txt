the frog universe represented us continuing to make homestuck fanworks

the :hatched_chick:universe represented us making sorta homestuck fanworks, all the numbers filed off and all the details changed but our flavor not to different.

i don't think the raptor universe ever meant anything in particular, it was just a joke. 

but. 


the echidna is us being disgusting and selfish and free and happy and cringe
and yes doing that means theres no room for homestuck fan works
either overt ones or with the numbers sanded off
but fuck those univereses
fuck those might have beens
they don't get our time and energy and resources
this horrible little flesh blob does

theres something funny about the fact that originally the echidna was the "bad end" we were trying to avoid on our path towards escaping the frog but ending up in the "hatched_chick"

it wasn't until i found zampanio that i realized i ... i WANTED that 'bad end'

i wanted to fall to the corruption


it feels gross and selfish and wrong to make something just for me, something i want and maybe no one else does. 

but we're allowed to.

all of us. 

you and me.





its okay. it has to be. to be happy with what you create.
