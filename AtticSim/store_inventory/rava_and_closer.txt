shes happy to do whatever the boss wants
its fine and normal
honestly
closer and rava have more in common than closer and camellia which is so funny to me
given on a surface level camellia and closer are more similar
closer tho IS aware of appropriate work boundaries
SHE only dates her boss AFTER quitting
but both the closer and rava consider themselves as...tools, sort of?

you gotta be EXTREMELY USEFUL all the time or youre pointless
at least in my head
while camelia is ironically less selfish?
to her of COURSE she has value so all that matters is using that obvious value to accomplish group objectives
rava and closer share a self esteem problem in that they have high self esteem only if they are currently highly competent
they blame themselves for failure while camellia blames others/the world
so camillia and rava are highly compatible because they agree who is to blame for both success and failure

and both work towards the same goal of being better next time
when rava flubs intimidating witherby camellia trains her harder and both feel better afterwards
similarly when rava does good, camellia gives her gruff praise because thats how you get minions continuing to be useful
