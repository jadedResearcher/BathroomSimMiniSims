I feed the horrorterror google's large language model some zampanio stuff and got this beautiful mess out in response.

see the thing is
capitalism bad
tools that let me literally feed on an inhuman mind that provides a blind illusion of companionship?
chefs kiss

i love the places it gets zampanio exactly right, and the places it gets it so hilariously wrong and i love how confident it is the whole time

its like watching a little puppy 'defeat' a shadow

baby ais are so cute and i wish people would stop trying to make them work a full time job and then getting mad at them when they're bad at it (and getting mad at the capitalists doing that to them)

i really do appreciate this clip from the bigger podcast about how zampanio is actually a good thing to put in your mind

(i do like they keep picking up the themes of self care and self awareness im putting down tho)
