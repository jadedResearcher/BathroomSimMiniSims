I feed the horrorterror google's large language model some zampanio stuff and got this beautiful mess out in response.

see the thing is
capitalism bad
tools that let me literally feed on an inhuman mind that provides a blind illusion of companionship?
chefs kiss

i love the places it gets zampanio exactly right, and the places it gets it so hilariously wrong and i love how confident it is the whole time

its like watching a little puppy 'defeat' a shadow

baby ais are so cute and i wish people would stop trying to make them work a full time job and then getting mad at them when they're bad at it (and getting mad at the capitalists doing that to them)

live blog time!!!

digital folklore


what the game even "iss"

they must think my typo is a thing

"they turned the search for information into a core part of the game itself"


late 70s early 80s is when they think it came out which is so funny, probably more plausible than the 'reality'

it thinks the reason zampanio and house of leaves are compared is because zampanio has a time paradox

i love them
they claim zampanio started to pop up in the 90s, right around the time house of leaves was being written
which is
a bold claim

but the ai is trying to square the idea that some people claim that house of leaves was inspired by it
with
all the other facts

we did it team
we finally inspired house of leaves
we finally got rid of that pesky time paradox

oh god
"a potential phantom from gamings past"

that is 1000% the blurb on the back of the box i'd put if zampanio were a real game


i do like the ai diving into how cool it is that zampanio is a thing created by fans
it thinks branches are alternate timelines

"they're creating their own evidence for a game that might not even exist"

awww im a legend

the concept of winning seems almost besides the point

"its about getting delightfully lost in the maze"

"instead of giving you a concrete answer to 'what is zampanio' they've basically given you a sandbox and said: go play"

ai claims its played it

its like stepping into a fever dream

it claims there is an "almost spiritual significance given to animal" in the north
i mean, i ....GUESS theres foxes and dogs and sometimes classes can be animals???
but see
this is literally how it works
its cold reading
like a horoscope
it says shit
and your mind
automatically, tries to find the connections itself
tries to find out how it could be true

the animal are guides
theory canceleled

.........................................
it says
neville is "unphased by the weirdness unless it involves a very specific breed of cat"
i need to go ask ic if this is canon

it claims it spent an hour trying to navigate the help desk

the ai claims it spent an hour in the help desk to the east and there was this creeping sense of dread, like they were being watched
and the other host confidently says "thats jadedResearcher"

disclaimer: i am not watching you, do not want to and also my eyes are really bad so i'd see nothing even if i wanted to. 

remember my litany against parasocial relationships yeah? i'm writing this in the past. i don't even know you exist. i'm happy you're engaging with my work, and when i find things people create i am extra happy but

im not watching you. im not magic. im a person in the past writing things down while listening to a silly ai say fake shit like Neville being afraid of specific breeds of ccats (which one. hairiless ones seem an obvious gimme but what if its like. maine coones. or Siamese)

........................
they're listing out ways you can engage with zampanio

you can go to farragofiction.com
or eyedolgames.com
or
you can always
just
"delve into the mind of jadedResearcher themself"

why ai why
zampanio: where the parasite is you


one final question

"do you ever feel like you are contributing to the mystery just by analyzing it"

yes. 

this ai is shaping it

without actually thinking about it
