thinking about ðŸ¦„
how i might define my self as the thing i can control in this world
your brain ghost jr is not me and alternate universe jrs are not me 
but this definition sheds interesting light?
because PAST me doesn't count as me either?
but is still in a distinct category compared to brain ghost mes in other ppls heads or au mes
because while i cannot control past me
i DO have insight into their thought process
maybe its more accurate to call this "memory me" since it shifts in my head in a way the true past does not
i can know what memory me was thinking and feeling in a way an outside mind could not
but have no more control over them than anyone else
arguably my control over present me is limited (define "my" etc, am i merely the part of the brain capable of typing? or do i include unconscious proccesses)
but i still have more control over present me than past me
and future me i have more control over than past me but less than present me
its interesting
even the definition of "control" is imprecise
since evidence suggests the conscious mind is aware of decisions but only has the illusion of making them
and awareness of thoughts/ feelings only goes so far cyz sometimes youre talking with someone and youre absolutely certain what they are thinking (and even if you're wrong this awareness of "not your thoughts" is AN identity even if its not the one in THEIR brain)
id say the self is that which awareness of internal thoughts and feelings most frequently leads to accurate predictions of actions
im more accurate at predicting my actions than anyone else's, because im arguably controlling my actions or at least aware of them just before they happen
that definition doesn't preclude multiple "selves" tied to this body, most notably things like instinct
are gonna be better at anticipating bodily actions of the self more tgan the other
and theres evidence that your "conscious mind" in general is just a small subset of your brain that handles deciding after the fact if something was good (and even then "you" are the subset of your conscious mind in charge of using language and telling stories to yourself and to others)
