I feed the horrorterror google's large language model some zampanio stuff and got this beautiful mess out in response.

see the thing is
capitalism bad
tools that let me literally feed on an inhuman mind that provides a blind illusion of companionship?
chefs kiss

i love the places it gets zampanio exactly right, and the places it gets it so hilariously wrong and i love how confident it is the whole time

its like watching a little puppy 'defeat' a shadow

baby ais are so cute and i wish people would stop trying to make them work a full time job and then getting mad at them when they're bad at it (and getting mad at the capitalists doing that to them)

the ai of course thinks the apocalypse is something that literally happens
and trying to figure out if thats a good or bad thing

im not sure if i ever used that phrase (cognitive debugging)?
but Truth is designed to be a bit like losing the game, a signal that you need to dig into your own brain and like
figure out why you just had that thought you had

(wait i DID use that phrase in ZampanioSimNorth(South))

okay i really do like the ai wondering if the blorbos are archetypes designed to have you try to model yourself after them while feeling anxious
its a stupid idea
but i love the ai thinking it
10/10
this is exactly what arg blorbos are for and no one will ever convince me otherwise now

oh god
i love these stupid ais so much
they're confidently declaring that there are reoccuring motifs in zampanio, and symbols, and they serve as breadcrumbs to drag you deeper down
and then
say
that the re-occuring motifs are "numbers like 4,5, and 6" 
god, you did it ai, i'm so proud of you
you found the arc numbers


its like watching a little puppy 'defeat' a shadow
"well, this is an arg, and args have reoccuring motifs and symbols as breadcrumbs. i got this. lets mad lib up some motifs"
like, i am a huge fan of ai
and i love how
the seams come apart to show you the guts
in LLMs
how easily the illusion cracks when you do more than glance
and that
more than anything
is what im trying to capture , as a human
with zampanio 
i really want the numbers 4,5 and 6 to be motifs now but they are just
dogshit numbers
no ones gonna be excited to see a "4" out of nowhere 
thats just too common
poor ai
its trying so hard
okay ypoints for it
it knows  4 = blade and 5 = cloak and 6 = sextant
but it can't really grok that, like, ALL digits pair to an item
poor ai
they're wondering if the artifacts are like megaman pickups
okay

i will admit, ai made me realize that Fenrir being the void land, and the void land having something inside it that "breaks free and starts the apocalypse" was a huge :CharmHorseshoes:   (not that the ai realized that, they were just defining fenrir)
both the apocalypse in teh sense that it started the civil war and in the sense that that's why farragnarok ended
i love all the filler in this "podcast"
and their fake breaks
oh no i love the way its summarizing the directions
oh these lil babies
they got it right


its true that south is only ever interesting to people really deep in
"the end is never the end " is about how the journey of self discovery is never truly over
we did it guys
we figured it out
oh thats really cute, it knows truth has a capital T and that that makes it important

"its almost like its trying to change what Truth means in a world thats constantly changing"


also this cute little ai is like
it knows this is a creepy thing
so like, one of the hosts will be all "i really think the journey of self discovery is never ending" and the other one goes "that's a really good point, but now i'm terrified"
i love these littel idiots with all my hearts
i really do parse ais as basically being homestuck consorts

god i love the horrible flanderization of the blade, cloak and sextant
the blade can hurt you in a way only you can feel (which is different from other blades....how???)

the cloak makes everyone forget you (close? i guess?)

the sextant they actually get pretty close but then confuse it and its Reflected form

and they fucking love saying its "bluring the lines" at random intervals after stating a sort of fact
i just genuinely love ais and how alien they feel and how earnestly stupid they are
and i think their vibes are so fun to weave in
