k is actually healthy enrichment to certain types of ppl
not devona

never devona
but camille and lee hunter and ria genuinely do well with k
for ria it's like
her despairing and wanting to burn it all is hard to keep up when k is like "OR  and hear me out,  you could look at me"
wibby would dig her outta the pit grimacing and covered in burns and SUFFERING

make her  feel guilty 
k would show up immaculately and be all like "wow you look like shit good thing you have ME now get showered we are going OUT because i am bored and understimulated" 
k's selfishness makes xer immune to rias Song
k does not give a shit that ria is burning out
which ironically is what she needs
the elephant in the room cant crush the mosquito, her problems arent destroying EVERYTHING because k is moisturized and in his lane
and k is good at manipulation
"no you CANT stay home because youd  be a bad example to leehunter" k says, selfishly, manupulatively
but its what ria needs
JR â€” Today at 11:51 AM
it interests me that witherby is "a better person"
he genuinely cares about ria and wants to help
but trying to help was killing him and actually making her worse
k is a gremlin asshole who cares only incidentally about others

but can genuinely be a force of healing in the right circumstances
wibby gets too caught up in internal morality
conflates suffering for caring for being Good
