IC and I brainstormed a game:

imagine a game where all the players are given premade character sheets, some stats, and a picture of the characters bedroom (think homestuck). Otherwise you know nothing about them.

You have bodysnatched them. 

Your job is to talk to npcs that know them, while pretending to be them, to learn facts about them, without giving yourself away. 

Is someone surprised you're cursing? Not cursing? Better have an excuse.

Your real objective is to figure out some important piece of information someone close to them has.  Is their mom a high ranking government official?  Is there brother a scientist working to discover aliens?

You start out all separated in your individual homes (unless you happen to live together), but joining up to support each other (and gaslight the real humans) is useful.
