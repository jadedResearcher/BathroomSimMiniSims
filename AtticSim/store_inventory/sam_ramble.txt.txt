JR — Today at 11:49 AM
but otherwise?
not looping
IC — Today at 11:49 AM
there is a new boss unless there's not
JR — Today at 11:49 AM
which means there's a thousand sams
and depending on what those in the loop are doing
sure A Sam can know johns a monster
but others might not
IC — Today at 11:50 AM
i love replaying my traumatic breakup
JR — Today at 11:50 AM
john isnt looping yet either iirc
IC — Today at 11:50 AM
yeah i dont believe so
JR — Today at 11:50 AM
so its just rava and twig and camellia watching john do this over and over
just like camellia watches Johns tiny loops
rava doesn't care and twig isnt gonna try to control john not to date sam
just knows not to show up near john till after the breakup
IC — Today at 11:51 AM
BAD IDEA turns out
JR — Today at 11:52 AM
john already started out dating twig as a bit of a "fuck you" to sam
can you imagine if he were tempted to do it WHILE dating sam still 
IC — Today at 11:52 AM
we call it the retroactive fuck you
i dont think hed be interested before it lol
twig's appeal is that they're sam but not controlling
JR — Today at 11:53 AM
i think like, riiiight at the very end, when sam and john are fighting a lot
john would be tempted not because of twig
but because "this would hurt sam"
IC — Today at 11:53 AM
like it's v much an i'm fucking your twin thing
JR — Today at 11:53 AM
exactly
"i dont need you so stop being such an entitled prick"
wheras if twig shows up after the breakup john is a little healthier
a little
IC — Today at 11:54 AM
he's not healthier as much as he is much more tolerable
that guy was NOT doing every drug under the sun and eating people (out) before that
JR — Today at 11:55 AM
lolol
true
i just like stray dog twig
IC — Today at 11:55 AM
woof woof
JR — Today at 11:56 AM
he shows up around john cuz john is fun and nice and gives them pets
but also they wander off and do other things 
IC — Today at 11:56 AM
[camellia voice] this place is a shitshow. i don't respect any of you people
JR — Today at 11:56 AM
lololol
camellia is entirely unsurprised watching john repeat the same mistakes every loop
its kinda his thing
even in the mini loops where he can remember 
mind if i grab this for my attic? i can only grab my bits if you prefer
IC — Today at 11:58 AM
do as you wish friend
JR — Today at 11:58 AM
i wanna make a Boss fic where its increasingly obvious its sam not hostage
