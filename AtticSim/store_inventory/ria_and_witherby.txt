JR: 
ria and witherby
i understand why they're so in each others grill more now
they both understand guilt
in a way no one else in training does
like, devona understands it in THEORY
she undrstands if she said or did something wrong she'll be killed with hammers
but ria and witherby feel it in their bones
guilt isn't a fear of consequences, its a consequence all on its own
while meanwhile neville and camille simply have never done anything wrong
(sarcasm)

IC: 
just never accept any guilt
keep going through the weave
but ria and witherby are very good at feeling guilty
it's just that witherby's impulse is to debate it in his head like a centrist
and ria's impulse is pipe bomb

JR: 

i wonder if melon would like her
can i put your words in my attic
