    <h2>Bones</h2>
    <li>blorbo night at the inventory means that if you have both doc slaughter and .... hmmm can't have wanda this is arm 2 BUT you can have slaughter and the witness in a room together and then switcch to inventory and run through their conversation to trigger the wanda therapy</li>
    <li>don't forget, The Boss was Ria's hostage, and she's somewhat web aligned. She'll see the threads Sam is using to puppet him.</li>
    <li>leehunter should always spawn twice (and it should not be clear which is which body)</li>
    <li>meanwhile twig is the one that accidentally frees peewee, breath player and all</li>
    <li>if the theme is KNOWING then start spawning random facts as books, and their description is their text (includes Sam's backstory inheirting the family), classic heir of blood</li>
    <li>when spawning blorbos don't forget to make most of them FleshCreatures (not captain and yongki tho :) :) :))
    </li>
    <li>you are absolutely playing as twig. great sense of smell,decent hearing,bad eyesight, very few morals</li>
    <li>flesh out default actions to be useful</li>
    <li>I am a genius, since this is North, don't actually make the inventory work, instead when you finally are able to open the inventory screen, its a Poker Night At the Inventory parody, staring twig</li>
    <li> trigger/effect system for adding things to the room (including exits) (should be a trigger of "has no exits" to
      add at least one exit)</li>
    <li> wire up default "look" behavior to list items, people and exits in the room and discuss the procedural
      description it has</li>
    <li> wire up default "move/go" behavior to pick a new room (decide how neighboring rooms work. i want a LITLE bit of
      stability, but delete the neighbors of any room more than three away from current)</li>

    <h2>Meat</h2>
    <li>audio design</li>
     <li> sobbing white night and gnashing peewee</li>
    <li>you can 'hack' to see the game as well, this is glitchy and wrong and all items try to render themselves, badly
      (at leats the ones made from data.js)</li>
    <li> make a placeholder game in the bathroom (i am so normal about the bathroom maze), for a text adventure game
    </li>
    <li> update PersonalityQuiz to generate a link to the bathroom (basically same as other link, seed, themes)</li>
    <li> themes and seed are used to generate the bathroom (means certain blorbos/items are locked to certain games)
    </li>
    <li> rival is around and is a HUGE ASSHOLE, if they are in a room they've already taken all the objects AND
      convinced everyone inside not to talk to you</li>
    <li> same ACTION words as EastEast, more or less (move/take/use/talk/look/taste/etc) </li>
    <li> game will not let you "get ye flask" to ANYTHING, its broken, there's an error message when you try saying
      "FINISH THE TUTORIAL TO GET YOUR INVENTORY!" except the way to finish it is broken</li>
    <li> you can hack the game to set the tutorial to complete. truth gets PISSY about this (flashes random spooky
      videos to 'punish' you) and rants about how much WORK was put in and you can't even be bothered to play the game
      normally, you probably don't even CARE about the plot, etc, etc</li>
    <li> you can hack the game to use a debug inventory (this activates east mode, it simply starts working)</li>
    <li> each room is created via a series of triggers/effects (what people or items are inside it) </li>
    <li> each entity (animate or otherwise) has a series of trigers/effects on what should happen if the various ACTIONs
      are deployed onto them, including default ones (i.e. you can only open a locked box if you have a key, you can
      only KILL a blorbo if you have a weapon, etc)</li>
    <li> its increasingly clear you're in Arm2</li>
    <li> doc slaughter is weeping and refuses to do anything (you can help her, and if you do the next iteration of Arm
      1 has Wanda start therapy)</li>
    <li>work in a novel use for the Fact engine i made for TruthSim (maybe if you help out white nightengale she'll give
      you facts every time you talk to her?)</li>
    <li> Peewee is trapped in a room that can not be exited, along with the Detective (Guide of Trapped Breath) (you can
      hack to get out, but if you do, Peewee escapes as well and gets into the Mundane Arm, where he wins)</li>
    <li> The Witness is also wandering</li>
    <li> Apocalypse Chick has the sweet lore to drop and thinks that even if you manage to free peewee (what she assumes
      your goal is) it'll just let her take this party on the road</li>
    <li> the game keeps track of Slaughter vs Peewee and sends it over to ButlerBot</li>
    <li> eventually I conclude which one people like more and make a Decision</li>
    <li>update personality quiz results to generate the link to the bathroom when it is done/ready</li>
    simple script where its 
    name: thing they're saying
    name2: thing they're saying
    i haven't written it yet but the engine will take all scripts and then figure out which ones are possible based on who is actually in the scene
    and then pick one possible one at random to display 'live'
    if there ends up being some scripts that are impossible (like i forget to even create a blorbo in the game) then its still accessible via wasting, and in human readable format
   <br><br>
   
   for every item in the inventory, have a big dumb pile up top where it tries to render itself (if possible) or has a dfault image (if not)

you can mouse over to see its name

then, at the bottom is whoever is currently speakings dialogue, wiht their name. 

if the name of an image matches the name of the current speaker, give them a lil bouncey animation to highlight them
leehunter should always spawn twice (and it should not be clear which is which body)
so i can do a "truth" like dialogue system
makes lil procedural noises while typing out letter by letter, when its done it doesn't move on till you click
that way its visual and text and doesn't require any special sauce<br><br>

idea:

    can i make the video game equivalent of foot notes?

    leave purposeful bugs in, but when they trigger theres a fake "bug report form"

    if you fill it out it sets a local storage variable and the next time you refresh the page the change log updates
    with the "bug" fixed and increasingly unhinged developer notes
    report bug button fixed in upper right hand corner, have first bug be if you try to GET anything theres a bug with
    an error code
    put error code into form to fix specific problems
    change log and dev notes on page load reverse chronological (can have real ones and then the new ones from local
    storage)

    since its north tho somehow it never fully fixes itself

    inventory keeps being locked but for new reasons each time (till it shifts to procedural ones)

    other bugs do fix tho (like "family" themed rooms wont let you leave), one bug per theme

    eventually if you hack the inventory to work you get to chat with true attic jr, and from then on you unlock "up"
    and "down" commands

    if you go up from a room you can see truth, if you go up from truth you can talk to attic jr again, if you go up
    from attic jr you get sent to my tumblr

    and down lets you enter any object or person as if they were a room
