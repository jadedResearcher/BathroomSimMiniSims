JR: 
you know
i wonder where ria gets her drugs
when she slips

IC: ah shit

JR: 
like obviously, ria slips LESS these days, and when she does slip she gives herself grace instead of spiralling on it and getting wores
but
i don't think she's you know, cold turkey
the more the Boss gets a chokehold on illicit activity, the more likely it is she has ties there
unless the mall just like
spawns weed in the lockers
and harder stuff

IC: 

 harder stuff

IC â€” Today at 11:00 PM
i think retroactively the boss gets to it
[11:00 PM]
it never was and also it always was

JR â€” Today at 11:01 PM
i think its fun that she has web ties
[11:01 PM]
and has to deal with the boss

IC â€” Today at 11:01 PM
the most web of all time

JR â€” Today at 11:01 PM
we know camille already works for him

IC â€” Today at 11:01 PM
i do think there's some sort of curious horror at having a rando become Someone

JR â€” Today at 11:01 PM
this
[11:01 PM]
he never fucking asked for any of this
[11:02 PM]
his only sin was a past version of him in an entirely different universe befriending a monster

IC â€” Today at 11:02 PM
ria does deals with some rando and suddenly the rando is back and they feel somehow very real

JR â€” Today at 11:02 PM
camille introduced them at some point before Hostage became the Boss

IC â€” Today at 11:02 PM
in some other world it could've been anyone else but now it will always be you

JR â€” Today at 11:02 PM
and i feel like boss can feel it
[11:02 PM]
that thread
[11:02 PM]
that connects him and ria
[11:02 PM]
they've MET
[11:03 PM]
and he doesn't know how to square that

IC â€” Today at 11:03 PM
yeaaaah

JR â€” Today at 11:03 PM
she seems normal
[11:03 PM]
especially compared to the freaky mute killers he's used to dealing with (edited)
[11:03 PM]
honestly she's kinda  abaseline junky to him
[11:03 PM]
all nervous sweating and sleep sunken eyes

IC â€” Today at 11:04 PM
alas
[11:04 PM]
This girls burned u alive before boy

JR â€” Today at 11:04 PM
he finds that out
[11:04 PM]
not the hard way
[11:04 PM]
but close enough
[11:04 PM]
when he loops a thread around her neck and instead it lights up (edited)
[11:05 PM]
this junkie isn't going to become one of his flies

IC â€” Today at 11:05 PM
WHOOPS

JR â€” Today at 11:05 PM
he spends a few loops with a half burnt face
[11:05 PM]
but it heals eventually
[11:05 PM]
he never charges her more than cost for drugs again tho
[11:05 PM]
and each loop that thread tying them together grows juust a bit stronger
[11:06 PM]
and it unsettles him more than all the freaky anime swords and shadow monsters in the world
[11:06 PM]
because its not his thread (edited)
[11:06 PM]
cuz remember
[11:06 PM]
the core of the Boss is wanting to be In Control in the face of Literal Monsters
[11:06 PM]
and he's not exactly going to handle another web player he can't control
[11:06 PM]
well

IC â€” Today at 11:07 PM
detroit become normal

JR â€” Today at 11:07 PM
you mind if i store this convo for my attic? i wanna write a fic for it too

IC â€” Today at 11:07 PM
sure

JR â€” Today at 11:08 PM
i think that thread makes him catnip to leehunter
[11:08 PM]
he's practically already wearing their uniform
[11:08 PM]
can they keep him?

IC â€” Today at 11:08 PM
pleaaase

JR â€” Today at 11:08 PM
maybe he's what finally lures them out of the basement
[11:08 PM]
their Conductor found a new member
[11:08 PM]
of course
[11:09 PM]
i think the Boss would flat out breach if that thread around his own neck tightened
[11:09 PM]
he's not wearing that fucking outfit
[11:09 PM]
he doens't know anything about music
[11:09 PM]
he's not exactly a joiner

IC â€” Today at 11:09 PM
jack noir shit

JR â€” Today at 11:09 PM
lolololol
[11:09 PM]
omg
[11:09 PM]
like a clown outfit

IC â€” Today at 11:09 PM
NOT wearing the mime suit

JR â€” Today at 11:09 PM
kill boxxy
[11:10 PM]
it IS v mime like isn't it
[11:10 PM]
silent orchestra
[11:10 PM]
huh

IC â€” Today at 11:10 PM
youre welcome

JR â€” Today at 11:10 PM
now the question becomes
[11:10 PM]
he's web
[11:10 PM]
magnus archives style
[11:10 PM]
but does an abnormality from the corporation take root in him?
[11:10 PM]
what does him breaching look like
[11:11 PM]
theres definitely spider abnormalities but do we really wanna go just, spider spider?

IC â€” Today at 11:12 PM
i personally prefer avoiding more abnos
[11:12 PM]
But i could b dissuaded

JR â€” Today at 11:13 PM
yeah it wouldn't quite feel right
[11:13 PM]
he'es not FROM there
[11:13 PM]
but i do want to give him some kind of wrinkle
[11:14 PM]
more than just a single note (hah pun)

IC â€” Today at 11:15 PM
ooh
[11:15 PM]
Go on

JR â€” Today at 11:18 PM
like
[11:18 PM]
theres something in the fact that
[11:18 PM]
we know so LITTLE about original flavor hostage
[11:18 PM]
we meet him tranqulized and loopy
[11:18 PM]
and then the very next anything we get from him is an entire loop later, after having a childhood haunted by the eye killer
[11:19 PM]
the hardness in him, the manipulation, the control complex.... im sure it had to root in SOMETHING native to him but
[11:19 PM]
who WAS he before
[11:19 PM]
and what parts might leak out into the world as he breaks down
[11:19 PM]
up till now he's faced monsters that are very straight forward
[11:20 PM]
they want egg or money and they might STAB you but they aren't exactly going to manipulate you
[11:20 PM]
right?
[11:20 PM]
he's twisted himself up to face THAT threat
[11:20 PM]
and now suddenly theres fucking HIVE MIND STEALER MAGIC BAND BULLSHIT?
[11:20 PM]
he's not ready
[11:21 PM]
loop after loop he remade himself to face the threat of the eye killer
[11:21 PM]
and now
[11:21 PM]
how is this fair
[11:21 PM]
even original him
[11:21 PM]
it wasn't even HIS FAULT he was kidnapped
[11:21 PM]
he was just some fucking pawn in his parents enemies games
[11:22 PM]
a chess piece only worth saving because losing would be embarssing
[11:22 PM]
he thought he could stop being a pawn by learning the play the game but here he fucking is again
[11:22 PM]
again
[11:22 PM]
i honestly feel like he might go the ria route
[11:22 PM]
not with fire but
[11:23 PM]
if it turns out you can't win even when you fucking finally earn a seat at the table
[11:23 PM]
what can you do but the pigeon gambit
[11:23 PM]
shit on the fucking game board and flip the table
[11:23 PM]
so thats what his knife is against ria
[11:24 PM]
you take that fucking thread off his throat, you get your fucking creepy ass not!twins out of his face or he will bring his criminal empire to the fucking ground
[11:24 PM]
he will destroy drug supply lines so throughly you won't even so much as smell cocain until 2030 and thats if you're lucky
[11:25 PM]
and he knows, he fucking KNOWS right, that the loop resets in 2020 so you're fucking shit out of luck if you think you're getting a single drop of illicit substance all loop if you cross him
[11:25 PM]
sure it destroys his power base

JR â€” Today at 11:25 PM
gives his enemies leverage to take everything he's fucking built with his own two hands
[11:25 PM]
but you are not going to test him, not on this
[11:26 PM]
he'll find a way to bring back fucking prohibition if he has to
[11:26 PM]
not even alcohol will be left
